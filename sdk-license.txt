transferable, perpetual license to store, use, analyse and blend the information it

receives from the Merchant.

c) All of the Software and Services are standardised and offered to all merchants

integrated with PaySense under a standard hosted model. The Software will be

available to multiple users (including the Merchant) through a multi-tenant hosted

computing environment.

d) Updates, when released, shall be made available to the Merchant at no additional

cost. The term “Update” means, subsequent releases of the Software that may be

generally made available by PaySense to all other entities who are licensed to use

the Software at no additional charge. Updates shall not include any releases, options

or future products which PaySense licenses or permits use of separately from the

Software and Services. Updates shall be considered part of the Software and be

subject to all terms, conditions and restrictions applicable thereto.
